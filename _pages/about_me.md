I am a 1st year PhD student in the school of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia, 
supervised by A/Prof. [Hassan Habibi Gharakheili](https://www2.ee.unsw.edu.au/~hhabibi/publications.html) and [Dr. Minzhao Lyu](https://minzhaolyu.github.io/). 
I completed my Honours Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering with specification of Telecommunications at UNSW in 2024.

My current research interests focus on **IoT security and network measurement**, particularly in the areas of IoT traffic analysis.
